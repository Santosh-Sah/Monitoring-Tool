The job itself can't be deleted.\r\nRestart with privileges : if \"Monitoring Tool\" is running on Vista or above and UAC is enabled, this button will cause \"Monitoring Tool\" to restart with full privileges. This will require an administrator account. This command is only available if the job management feature is not available to the user.\r\nDouble-click on a job to open a detailed view of the job. See Detailed view for job.\r\n\r\nMonitor\r\n\r\nThese features are available in the 'Monitor' tab of the main form. Use the icons on the ribbon, or use the popup menu (right-click on the treeview). This feature allows to use the \"performance counters\" of Windows available on the system (local system if connection type is local, or remote system if connection type is remote via WMI). Here are the available actions :\r\n\r\nAdd : adds a counter. You will have to select a category, a counter and an instance (if required). You have to set the interval of refreshment (1000 ms by default).\r\nRemove selection : removes the counters selected in the tree\r\nStart/Stop : starts or stops the counters selected in the tree\r\nSave report : saves a report\r\nTo see a \"performance counter\", select it in the tree. Then the associated graph will be displayed.\r\n\r\nIf you do not check 'Automatic' box, the left side of the graph will represent the date/time you specified\r\nIf you check 'Now' box, the right side of the graph will represent the current date/time, else it will represent the date/time you selected\r\nIf you check 'Automatic', or do not check 'Now', or check both, the number of values displayed will be determined by the number you specified (Max. values).\r\nServices\r\n\r\nThese features are available in the 'Services' tab of the main form. Use the icons on the ribbon, or use the popup menu (right-click on the listview). All actions are available for the different services you select in the list.\r\nFile properties : opens the Windows property dialog box about the executable.\r\nOpen directory : opens the directory which contains the executable file.\r\nFile details : shows details of the executable in the 'File' tab.\r\nInternet search : searches for the executable name on the Internet.\r\nShow dependencies : opens the Dependency viewer to see dependencies of the selected service.\r\nPause/Resume : pauses (or resumes) the selected service.\r\nStop : stops the selected service\r\nStart : starts the selected service\r\nChange start type : changes the start type of the selected service.\r\nDelete : deletes the selected service.\r\nReanalyze : refreshes some informations which are not automatically refreshed, for example the 'Start type'\r\nNetwork connections\r\n\r\nThese features are available in the 'Network' tab of the main form.

Then, enter the string you want to search, validate with 'Return' key and click on'Launch'.\r\n\r\nYou can close an item (i.e. terminate process for processes, unload module for modules, close handle for handles...) with 'Close item' menu.\r\n\r\nRemote management\r\n\r\nChange connection type\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do to monitor a remote system is to change the connection type. There are three different connection types :\r\n\r\nLocal : this is the default connection type. It is used to monitor the local system only.\r\nRemote via WMI : this is used to monitor a remote system via WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation).\r\nRemote via \"Monitoring Tool\" server : this is used to monitor a remote system via a client-server architecture.\r\nTo change the connection type, you have to open the 'Connection window' (Menu -> Change connection type). Then, disconnect from current machine, choose the new connection, configure it and click on 'Connect'.\r\n\r\nWhich connection type should I choose ?\r\n\r\nIf you want to monitor the local machine, use 'local connection'.\r\n \r\nIf you want to monitor a remote machine, there are different points you should consider :\r\nIf you only want the list of processes/services with basic informations, Start/Stop features, you should use WMI\r\nIf you do not have an account on the remote machine, you have to use \"Monitoring Tool\" server\r\nIf you want to use Windows Performance Counters, you have to use WMI\r\nIf you want to monitor the remote system and manage handles, memory or use some other advanced features, you have to use the server\r\nIf you want to save reports about the remote system, you have to use the server\r\nIf you want to search something with Search feature, you have to use the server\r\nIn other cases, keep in mind that :\r\nThe server should always work (even if WMI is not installed for example), this is not the case of WMI\r\nWMI might be easiest to use (nothing to start manually on the remote machine)\r\nWMI method\r\n\r\nWMI method is the easiest way to monitor a remote system. You only need an account with a password on the remote machine. WMI must also be available in the remote machine (RPC server must be started). Here are the steps you should follow to connect \"Monitoring Tool\" to the remote machine :\r\n\r\nstart the remote machine and launch \"Monitoring Tool\" on the local machine\r\ndisconnect \"Monitoring Tool\" from the local machine\r\nchoose 'WMI connection'\r\nenter the name of the remote machine\r\nenter your username and your password (empty passwords are NOT allowed)\r\nconnect to remote machine ('Connect' button)\r\nWMI is a nice way to monitor remote computers, but it is really limited. Only some informations/features are available :\r\n\r\nList of processes (but some informations are not available)\r\nList of services (but some informations are not available)\r\nList of modules (but some informations are not available)\r\nList of threads (but some informations are not available)\r\nNew process / Kill process / Change process priority\r\nSome actions on services (start, stop, pause...)\r\nClient-server method\r\n\r\nClient-server method is more complex than WMI and it requires to run something (\"Monitoring Tool\" as a server) on the remote machine. But it allows to monitor the processes/services/modules/... and all related objects just as if you were monitoring a local machine : all features/informations are available (except performance counters).\r\n\r\nHere are the steps you should follow to connect \"Monitoring Tool\" to the remote machine :\r\n\r\nstart the remote machine and launch \"Monitoring Tool\" on the local machine\r\nstart \"Monitoring Tool\" as a server on the remote machine (you could use launch server.bat, it launches \"Monitoring Tool\" with -server option).\r\ndisconnect \"Monitoring Tool\" from the local machine\r\nchoose 'Client-server connection'\r\nenter the IP of the remote machine, and select the port number you used when starting the server (8085 by default)\r\nconnect to remote machine ('Connect' button)\r\nEmergency hotkeys\r\n\r\nThis is a feature which allows to assign a shortcut to a specified action. Once you have open the 'Emergency hotkeys' window (Menu -> Emergency hotkeys), right-click on the listview and choose 'Add'. Then select the shortcut you want to use and the action you want to associate with it. 'Remove' command delete the action definitevely (use Enable/Disable to temporarily remove a previous added shortcut). The shortcut are saved in 'hotkeys.xml' file in \"Monitoring Tool\" directory.\r\n\r\nNote that the actions available depends from the version of \"Monitoring Tool\" you are using. For now, you can not add your own custom actions, and only two actions are available : \"Kill foreground application\" and \"Exit \"Monitoring Tool\"\".\r\n\r\nThe shortcuts will only be active when \"Monitoring Tool\" is running.\r\nNote that the shortcuts only affect the local machine.\r\n\r\nFind Window Process\r\n\r\nThis feature allows to find the process associated to a window displayed on the screen. Once you have open the 'Find Window' process' window (Menu -> \"target icon\"), click on the window and drag your mouse over the screen. Select the desired window and release the left button of your mouse, it will select the process associated to the window.\r\n\r\nShow hidden processes\r\n\r\nThis feature allows to view hidden processes, such as rootkits. As it uses user mode functions (no kernel functions), it shows only basic rootkits. There are two methods of detection available, you can change the method by clicking on the small \"shield icon\" on the bottom of the window.\r\n\r\nCreate a service\r\n\r\n\"Monitoring Tool\" allows to create services. (this feature is available using the main menu). To create a service, you have to specify some informations (name of the service, service type...etc.). If you want to create a service on a remote machine, you will have to specify a machine name, a user name and the associated password. \"Monitoring Tool\" will then copy the executable you selected to the remote machine and starts the service on the remote machine as a local service.\r\n\r\nDetailed view for processes\r\n\r\nWhen you double-click on a process (on the list of the processes on the main form), it opens a form which shows all available informations about the process. There are 16 different tabs :\r\n\r\nGeneral : general informations about the process ('Get online infos' displays online informations about the process, depending on its name)\r\nStatistics : all numerical informations available about the process\r\nPerformances : three performance graphs (Cpu usage with average cpu usage, physical memory usage, I/O delta)\r\nToken : displays privileges. Enable/Disable/Remove menus allows to enable/disable/remove the selected privileges\r\nMemory : displays all the memory regions of the process. 'View memory' menu opens the hex editor and shows the memory at the region' base address. 'Jump to peb' menu opens the hex editor and shows the memory at the PEB address. You can also free/decommit memory regions and even change memory protection type.\r\nInformations : displays informations as text (RTF)\r\nServices : displays services owned by the process\r\nNetwork : displays TCP/UDP connections opened by the process\r\nStrings : displays strings readable in the image file (on the disk) or in memory. It is possible to save the results and search a sub-string.\r\nEnvironment : displays all the environment variables of the process\r\nModules : displays loaded modules. 'View memory' menu opens the hex editor and shows the memory at the module' base address.\r\nThreads : displays threads of the process\r\nWindows : displays windows of the process\r\nHandles : displays handles opened by the process. \"File\" handles are only shown if \"Monitoring Tool\" kernel driver is loaded. Double-click on a handle to display detailed informations about the handle and some available actions, depending of the type of handle you've selected.\r\nLog : powerful tool to monitor all changes made by/on a process. See Log feature.\r\nHistory : displays the history of one or more numerical counter(s). Select the desired counters on the left to display the associated graphs on the right. The history of all processes is collected in memory in real time and there is no need to open the detail view of the processes to collect informations, but the size of informations collected is limited. By default, only 100KB of history data are stored by process. You can configure it (or set it as unlimited) in the 'Preferences' window.\r\nHeaps : displays the list of heap nodes of the process. You will have to unlock this feature using the specific button on the listview. Please note that for now, \"Monitoring Tool\" could crash when trying to enumerate heaps of some specific processes. When heap nodes are displayed, you can view associated blocks by double-clicking on a heap node. You can then view the memory of the process (using the hex-editor) by double-clicking on a heap block.\r\nDetailed view for services\r\n\r\nWhen you double-click on a service (list of the services on the main form), it opens a form which shows all available informations about the service. There are 4 tabs :\r\n\r\nGeneral - 1 : displays general informations ('Get online infos' displays online informations about the service, depending on its name)\r\nGeneral - 2 : some other informations\r\nDependencies : displays dependencies of the service\r\nInformations : displays informations as text (RTF)\r\nDetailed view for jobs\r\n\r\nWhen you double-click on a job (list of the jobs on the main form), it opens a form which shows all available informations about the job. There are 3 tabs :\r\n\r\nGeneral : displays processes in the job\r\nStatistics : displays statistics about the job\r\nLimitations : displays limits applied to the job. It also allows user to specify new limits for the job.\r\nLog feature\r\n\r\nThis feature allows to monitor all changes made by/on a process (Process detail view -> Log tab). Check 'Activate log' to enable the feature to collect the changes.\r\nClick on 'Options' and choose the desired options :\r\n\r\nCapture : the changes to monitor. For example, if you check 'Handles', it will monitor the handles opened/closed by the process. Check 'Created' and/or 'Deleted' to monitor new objects and/or deleted objects (in our example : opened handles and/or closes handles).\r\nShow : the items to show on the list. If you uncheck all boxes, nothing will be displayed, and if you check all boxes, all collected changes will be displayed. This option should be used for two reasons : to see only specific changes (example : you monitor everything and just want to see new threads), and to economize CPU usage (when all options are activated, display all changes may require a lot of CPU time)\r\nInterval : the interval between two 'snapshots of informations'. If you specify a small value, it may will require a lot of CPU time.\r\nAuto scroll : automatically scroll (or not) the view (i.e. ensure that the last item of the listview is available).\r\nDependency viewer\r\n\r\nThis feature allows to view dependencies of an executable/*.dll/*.sys. If the Dependency viewer is shown with Module->Show dependencies or Process->Show dependency, there is no need to select the file, otherwise you will have to use 'Open...' menu.\r\n\r\nOnce your file is opened, you will see the import/export tables and all informations available in a classical Dependency viewer.\r\n\r\n*System Snapshot Feature*\r\n\r\nThis feature is designed for remote assistance (for example on an Internet forum). Here is how you should use it :\r\n\r\nyou have a problem on your computer (for example it's slow, or buggy, or you don't know how to remove a malware)\r\nyou download \"Monitoring Tool\" and install it\r\nyou start \"Monitoring Tool\" and save a snapshot of your system using the associated menu\r\nyou  upload your System Snapshot File on a website such as http://megaupload.com/\r\nyou post a message on a computer Internet forum explaining what is your problem, and you give a link to download your System Snapshot File\r\nanyone who has \"Monitoring Tool\" installed on his computer can download your System Snapshot File and use it to determine what is the problem of your system :\r\nfirst step is to connect \"Monitoring Tool\" to the System Snapshot File (using Change connection type -> Snapshot -> Select the System Snapshot File -> Connect)\r\nthen it is possible to analyze the system as if the user is running \"Monitoring Tool\" to analyze a local machine, and it's easy to determine what is the problem of the system\r\nIt is also possible to explore a System Snapshot File to see which data are stored in it by using the Explore System Snapshot File menu.\r\n\r\n# Using the command line\r\n\r\n*Here are the different arguments which can be used in command line to start \"Monitoring Tool\" :*\r\n\r\nTo start \"Monitoring Tool\" as a server :\r\n-server [-hide] -port PORT_NUMBER\r\n-server : specifies server mode to be used\r\n-hide : hide the GUI of the server (optional)\r\n-port PORT_NUMER : specifies the port number to use for network communication\r\nExample : \"Monitoring Tool\".exe -server -hide -port 12700\r\nOther parameters :\r\n-nodriver : \"Monitoring Tool\" won't use its driver in kernel mode\r\n-ssfile FILE_NAME : does not start \"Monitoring Tool\" but only create a snapshot file of the system, and save it as FILE_NAME file (relative or absolute path).\r\nOther features & tips\r\n\r\nHere are some other features and tips you should know when using \"Monitoring Tool\" :\r\n\r\n*You should read the tooltips when you move your mouse over a control, there are some useful informations.\r\n'Escape' key should close opened forms.\r\nMiddle-mouse-click on a listview should copy the informations displayed for the selected items into the clipboard. 'Right-click -> Menu Copy to clipboard' allows to copy some specific informations to the clipboard.\r\nCtrl+Shift keys on an item on a listview will display the pending tasks concerning the item.\r\nDouble-click on an item on a listview (or F7 key) will display the list of properties about the item.\r\nCtrl+F keys on a listview on the process detailed view will display a useful search panel on the bottom of the window.*\r\n\r\n***Some of the features of \"Monitoring Tool\" are not available with remote monitoring.
